Subject: Notification of Insurance Claim – Motor Vehicle Incident (No Third Party Involved)

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to formally notify you of a motor vehicle accident that occurred on April 3, 2024, at approximately 9:30 PM on MG Road, Pune. I, Mr. Rakesh Sharma, was driving my vehicle – a 2018 Honda City – when I lost control due to slippery road conditions caused by ongoing heavy rain.

As a result, my vehicle skidded and struck a stationary light pole. No other vehicle or third-party was involved in this incident. I acknowledge that I was traveling above the recommended speed for such weather conditions, which contributed to the loss of control.

This was a single-vehicle accident. A traffic police report was filed and confirms that there is no evidence of third-party involvement or negligence.

The damages I sustained include:
- Front bumper and headlight damage
- Scratches and dents to the left door panel
- Minor personal injuries (bruising and muscle strain), for which I have attached medical records

I am claiming reimbursement under my comprehensive motor insurance policy for:
- Vehicle repair: ₹42,000
- Medical expenses: ₹3,500

Please find attached the following supporting documents:
1. Police Report
2. Garage Repair Estimate and Invoice
3. Medical Bill and Prescription

I understand this incident does not present an opportunity for subrogation as no liable third-party exists.

Please let me know if any further documents are required to process my claim.

Sincerely,  
Rakesh Sharma  
(Signature)
