To Whom It May Concern,

On March 12, 2024, our insured, Mr. John Doe, was involved in a rear-end collision caused by a vehicle operated by Jane Smith. The police report confirms the liability of the third party.

The damages to the insured’s vehicle have been assessed and paid by our company totaling ₹75,000. Attached are the repair bills and photographs.

We believe the liability clearly rests with the third party and intend to pursue recovery.

Sincerely,
XYZ Insurance Co.
